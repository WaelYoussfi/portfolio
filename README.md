This is the code source of my personal portfolio website.
It was built using Nextjs, Tailwind, Typescript and Cypress for E2E testing.

# Requirements

## nodejs 18.16.1

## eslint

## an IDE of your choice

personally I use VScode

## yarn package manager

if you have nodejs >= 16.10 you can use corepack to manage yarn without any further installations:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate
```

# Getting Started

```bash
yarn install

### run the linter:

```bash
yarn lint
```

### build the project:

```bash
yarn build
```

### start the project:

```bash
yarn start
```

### start cypress:

```bash
